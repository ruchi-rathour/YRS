In this project I am trying to create a yoga recommender system. 
It would be a web application where users can create their account and can login.
Given their illnesses and their prior exposure to yoga, we can suggest them some yoga asanas which would be beneficial for them.

The model uses a deep learning model which predicts the most suitable asan. Employed basic NLP techniques to preprocess the text data.
The whole project uses LAMP stack.
